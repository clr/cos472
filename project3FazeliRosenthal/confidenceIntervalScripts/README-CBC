Instructions for running Awk and Gnuplot
  This will all work best if you run awk and gnuplot from the directory
  that contains the relevant files
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Files here:
data-in        -- example data from runs
awk.confidence -- awk script; generates data for confidence intervals
                    (creates file data-confidence from data-in)
awk.pairedt    -- awk script; generates data for paired-t tests
                    (creates file data-pairedt from data-in)
confidence.g   -- gnuplot instructions; generates confidence intervals
	            (jpg or png file)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Get your data in the right format
   (see data-in)

2. run awk to get confidence intervals and paired-t tests

     awk -f awk.confidence data-in > data-confidence
     awk -f awk.pairedt data-in > data-pairedt

3. run gnuplot to plot your confidence intervals

     gnuplot confidence.g

   this creates the file intervals.jpg

   Note: it's possible that png files will work better there are two lines in
   the confidence.g file that control this -- set terminal and set output.

4. If you are in the Linux lab and you want to view this before printing it,
   you can run display, e.g.,  
    
     display intervals.jpg

   You can also put this in your public_www and view it through a browser,
   which is what you'd want to do during the lab.

5. Print, if you like, using lpr

     lpr intervals.jpg
   
6. If you will be writing your paper on a Mac or Windows machine, use an FTP
   client to pull the file over to your machine. (Or else, use the browser
   approach.) You should then be able to insert the figure into a Word
   document. 


You can also use gnuplot interactively, which is handy if you're going to be
mucking with what you're drawing. Do do this, comment out all the lines that
begin with "set terminal" and "set output", and run gnuplot (while logged in
directly on a Linux machine). You can then start gnuplot with no arguments,
and load the file in at the gnuplot prompt, for example:
     gnuplot
     load "confidence.g"

If you don't like what you see, you can edit the file and reload it without
quitting out of gnuplot.

Note that there's a bug in gnuplot in terms of labelling the vertical axis. It
displays wrong when you view it through gnuplot, but is fine in the final file
(next step).

To save to a file while running interactively, while still running gnuplot:

  set terminal jpeg
  set output "intervals.jpg"
              (or some other filename)

This will create a file called intervals.jpg that can be sent to a
printer and/or incorporated into other documents.

To quit from gnuplot, type quit
